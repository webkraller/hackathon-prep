# HACKATHON PREP
The goal is to create a dataset of potentially harmful/disrespectful users on twitter and export them to an existing repository, such as BlockBot.
## METHOD
1) Tweets get flagged by twitter users via form submission or from javascript bookmarlet
2) These tweets are displayed on the main page
3) The community votes on whether the tweet is potentially harmful/disrespectful
4) If a user hits a sufficient number of negative votes across multiple tweets, this user is flagged
5) Flagged users get submitted to BlockBot.
